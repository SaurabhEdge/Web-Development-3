  <dd><br>- India's total land mass is <code class="cite">2,973,190 square kilometers</code> and is divided into three main 
    geological regions: <code class="cite">the Indo-Gangetic Plain</code>, <code class="cite">the Himalayas</code>, 
    and <code class="cite">the Peninsula region</code>. </dd>
<dd><br>-  The Indo-Gangetic Plain and those portions of the Himalayas within India are 
  collectively known as North India. South India consists of the peninsular region, often 
  termed simply the Peninsula. </dd>
  <dd><br>-  On the basis of its physiography, India is divided into ten regions: <code class="cite">the 
    Indo-Gangetic Plain</code>, <code class="cite">the northern mountains of the Himalayas</code>, 
    <code class="cite">the Central Highlands</code>,
    <code class="cite">the Deccan or Peninsular Plateau</code>, 
    <code class="cite">the East Coast (Coromandel Coast in the south)</code>, 
    <code class="cite">the West Coast (Konkan, Kankara, and Malabar coasts)</code>, 
    <code class="cite">the Great Indian Desert</code> 
     (a geographic feature known as the Thar Desert in Pakistan) and 
     <code class="cite">the Rann of Kutch</code>, 
     <code class="cite">the valley of the Brahmaputra in Assam</code>, the northeastern hill ranges surrounding 
     <code class="cite">the Assam Valley</code>, and <code class="cite">the islands of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal</code>.</dd>

<dd><br><h3><b> Indo-Gangetic Plain </b></h3></dd>
<dd>- In social and economic terms, the Indo-Gangetic Plain is the most important region of India.
   The plain is a great alluvial crescent stretching from the Indus River system in Pakistan to
    the Punjab Plain (in both Pakistan and India) and the Haryana Plain to the delta of the Ganga
     (or Ganges) in Bangladesh (where it is called the Padma).</dd>

  </figure>
</dd>
<dd>- Topographically the plain is homogeneous, with only floodplain bluffs and other 
  related features of river erosion and changes in river channels forming important natural features. </dd>

 <dd><br>- Two narrow terrain belts, collectively known as the Terai, constitute the northern 
  boundary of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Where the foothills of the Himalayas encounter the plain,
   small hills known locally as ghar (meaning house in Hindi) have been formed by coarse sands 
   and pebbles deposited by mountain streams.</dd>

<dd><br>-  Groundwater from these areas flows on the surface where the plains begin and converts 
  large areas along the rivers into swamps. The southern boundary of the plain begins along the 
  edge of the Great Indian Desert in the state of Rajasthan and continues east along the base
   of the hills of the Central Highlands to the Bay of Bengal.</dd>

  <dd><br>- The hills, varying in elevation from 300 to 1,200 meters, lie on a general east-west axis. 
    The Central Highlands are divided into northern and southern parts. The northern part is centered 
    on the Aravalli Range of eastern Rajasthan. In the northern part of the state of Madhya Pradesh, 
    the Malwa Plateau comprises the southern part of the Central Highlands and merges with the 
    Vindhya Range to the south. The main rivers that flow through the southern part of the 
    plain--the Narmada, the Tapti, and the Mahanadi--delineate North India from South India.</dd>

    <dd><br>- The middle Ganga extends from the Yamuna River in the west to the state of West
       Bengal in the east. The lower Ganga and the Assam Valley are more lush and verdant 
       than the middle Ganga. The lower Ganga is centered in West Bengal from which it 
       flows into Bangladesh and, after joining the Jamuna (as the lower reaches of the
        Brahmaputra are known in Bangladesh), forms the delta of the Ganga.</dd>

<!--   The Himalayas -->
 
<dl><dt></dt>
  <dd><br><h3><b> The Himalayas </b></h3></dd>
  <dd>- The Himalayas, the highest mountain range in the world, extend along the northern 
    frontiers of Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Burma. They were formed geologically 
    as a result of the collision of the Indian subcontinent with Asia.</dd>
  <dd><br>
  <figure class="left_next zoomin">
    <img src="/~ss7586/ISTE646/Final/assets/media/geography1.gif" alt="flag" 
    width="300" height="300" class="responsive_img_1">
    <figcaption class="glen-cap">Geography 2 </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </dd>
  <dd><br>- This process of plate tectonics is ongoing, and the gradual northward drift of the
     Indian subcontinent still causes earthquakes (see Earthquakes, this ch.). Lesser
      ranges jut southward from the main body of the Himalayas at both the eastern and 
      western ends.</dd>

  <dd><br>-  The Himalayan system, about 2,400 kilometers in length and varying in width from 240
     to 330 kilometers, is made up of three parallel ranges--the Greater Himalayas, the Lesser 
     Himalayas, and the Outer Himalayas--sometimes collectively called the Great Himalayan Range. </dd>


  <dd><br>- The Greater Himalayas, or northern range, average approximately 6,000 meters in height
     and contain the three highest mountains on earth: Mount Everest (8,796 meters) on the 
     China-Nepal border; K2 (8,611 meters, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, and in China 
     as Qogir Feng) in an area claimed by India, Pakistan, and China; and Kanchenjunga (8,598 meters) 
     on the India-Nepal border. 
  
  </dd>
    <dd><br>- Many major mountains are located entirely within India, such as Nanda Devi (7,817 meters)
       in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The snow line averages 4,500 to 6,000 meters on the southern 
       side of the Greater Himalayas and 5,500 to 6,000 on the northern side. Because of climatic 
       conditions, the snow line in the eastern Himalayas averages 4,300 meters, while in the 
       western Himalayas it averages 5,800 meters.</dd>

      <dd><br>- The area of northeastern India adjacent to Burma and Bangladesh consists of 
        numerous hill tracts, averaging between 1,000 and 2,000 meters in elevation, 
        that are not associated with the eastern part of the Himalayas in Arunachal Pradesh.
         The Naga Hills, rising to heights of more than 3,000 meters, form the watershed
          between India and Burma. The Mizo Hills are the southern part of the northeastern
           ranges in India. The Garo, Khasi, and Jaintia hills are centered in the state 
           of Meghalaya and, isolated from the northeastern ranges, divide the Assam 
           Valley from Bangladesh to the south and west.</dd>

<!--   Offshore Islands -->
  
<dl><dt></dt>
  <dd><br><h3><b> Offshore Islands </b></h3></dd>
  <dd>- India's offshore islands, constituting roughly one-quarter of 1 percent of the nation's 
    territory, lie in two groups located off the east and west coasts. The northernmost point
     of the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands lies 1,100 kilometers southeast
      of Calcutta. </dd>
  
  <dd><br>- Situated in the Bay of Bengal in a chain stretching some 800 kilometers, the Andaman
     Islands comprise 204 islands and islets, and their topography is characterized by hills
      and narrow valleys.</dd>

  <dd><br>- Although their location is tropical, the climate of the islands is tempered by 
    sea breezes; rainfall is irregular. The Nicobar Islands, which are south of the Andaman 
    Islands, comprise nineteen islands, some with flat, coral-covered surfaces and others with hills. </dd>


  <dd><br>- The islands have a nearly equatorial climate, heavy rainfall, and high temperatures. 
    The union territory of Lakshadweep (the name means 100,000 islands) in the Arabian Sea, 
    comprises--from north to south--the Amindivi, Laccadive, Cannanore, and Minicoy islands. 
  
  </dd>
    <dd><br>- The islands, only ten of which are inhabited, are spread throughout an area of 
      approximately 77,000 square kilometers. The islands are low-lying coral-based formations 
      capable of limited cultivation.</dd>
