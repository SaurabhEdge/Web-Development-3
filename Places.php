<!--  Varanasi -->
<dl><dt></dt>

  <dd><br>- Deeply traditional yet endlessly surprising, India is one of those destinations that ends up on 
    every traveler's bucket list at some point. They might dream of going to Agra to see the Taj 
    Mahal in all its glory or exploring the royal palaces scattered throughout Rajasthan. </dd>
<dd><br>- Others find themselves attracted to the jaw-dropping landscapes in Darjeeling and Rishikesh, 
  or the postcard-perfect beaches in Goa.</dd>

<dd><br><h3><b> Varanasi </b></h3></dd>
<dd>- With a history dating back to more than 3,000 years, Varanasi is one of the world’s oldest living cities.
  Located in North India on the banks of the River Ganges, Varanasi has been an important center of learning 
  for ages as well as a chief pilgrimage destination for many Hindus.</dd>

  </figure>
</dd>
<dd>- Varanasi is regarded as a sacred city among Hindus, Jains and Buddhists because it is believed that 
  dying here releases a person’s soul from the cycle of reincarnation, and that bathing in the River 
  Ganges cleanses one’s sins.</dd>

 <dd><br>- Varanasi offers sights and experiences unknown anywhere else in the world. It is nicknamed 
  the “City of Temples” because of its thousands of temples. Some of the most significant are the Kashi 
  Vishwanath Temple of Shiva, the Durga Temple and the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, which is known for
   housing numerous monkeys.</dd>

<dd><br>- Probably the most famous sites of the city are the ghats, the series of embankment steps leading 
  down to the Ganges River, where many people gather to bathe. The oldest and main ghat is the
   Dashashwamedh Ghat. The Manikarnika Ghat is a burning ghat where Hindu cremations and rituals of 
   death anniversaries are frequently held. Yoga, shaves and massages are other activities available here. 
   The best way to see the ghats is by taking a morning boat ride at sunrise.</dd>
    <dd><br>- Silk weaving is popular in Varanasi, and there are scores of shops and markets selling silk 
      products like sarees and scarves in addition to other handicrafts.</dd>

<dl><dt></dt>
<dd><br><h3><b> Amritsar </b></h3></dd>
<dd>- While in Amritsar, plan to spend an afternoon at the border of Pakistan to see the Beating Retreat Ceremony. 
  Goose-stepping guards from long-term rivals India and Pakistan open and close the border gates at dusk in 
  an over-the-top ceremony you'll never forget. Get there early to dance to blaring Bollywood music with 
  locals in the streets.</dd>

<figcaption class="glen-cap">Amritsar </figcaption>
</figure>
</dd>
<dd>- The main attraction in Amritsar is the Golden Temple, also known 
  as the Harmandir Sahib. Built more than 400 years ago, this temple truly is golden,
   and it is always packed with Sikhs visiting from around India and the rest of the world.</dd>

<dd><br>-  You can tour the Golden Temple regardless of religion, but you will need to show
 respect by covering your head and removing your shoes. </dd>

<dd><br>- Enter the temple through the Ghanta Ghar, the main entrance, and admire the Amrit Sarovar, a pool 
  surrounding the temple where pilgrims bathe. </dd>
<dd><br>- Amritsar, the "Jewel of Punjab," has made its claim to fame with its remarkable Golden Temple. 
  One of the holiest places in the world for Sikhs, the gilded structure is a sight to behold, 
  glistening in the sun and reflecting into the large pool that surrounds it.</dd>

<dd><br>- The attraction also boasts the world's largest community kitchen, which serves 100,000 diners 
   lentils and curries every day.In the northern province of Punjab is Amritsar,

<dd><br><h3><b> Laddakh </b></h3></dd>
<dd>- In northernmost India, in the heavily disputed Kashmir region, is the mountainous destination of Ladakh.</dd>
<dd><br>
<figure class="right_next zoomin">

<figcaption class="glen-cap">Laddakh</figcaption>
</figure>
</dd>

<dd>-  
  While you're in the area, make a reservation on the Kalka-Shimla Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
  The 96.6-kilometer-long railroad, which has been running for over a century, is renowned for its stunning 
  views and authentic vintage experience.
</dd>
<dd><br>
The cloudy weather and forested hillsides make for a satisfying escape from the heat, as well as a placid 
place to spend a weekend or more. The atmosphere in the hilly central part of town, where traffic is banned, 
is just as pleasant as the scenic outskirts.</dd>
<dd><br>-  
   This region is large, but it has a low population density and a number of nomadic residents. Breathtaking, 
   pristine scenery is a major draw to the area, but virtually all travelers will also spend time in the town of Leh.</dd>

<dd><br>- The town is located at a very high elevation, and it is also home to the 17th century Palace of 
  the King of Ladakh. Buddhist culture is also prominent in Leh, and you may wish to explore some of the many 
  Buddhist monasteries and temples in the Old Town.</dd>

  monuments cut into the rock as far back as the 2nd century BC.</dd>

<dd><br>- Around 100 kilometers southwest, the Ellora Caves contain nearly three dozen Buddhist, Jain, 
  and Hindu carvings, the most famous of which is the Kailasa Temple (Cave 16), a massive structure 
  devoted to Lord Shiva that features life-size elephant sculptures. The magnificent carvings at 
  both sites will leave you filled with wonder.</dd>    

<dd><br>- Two hours away is Ajanta, which is also home to 29 caves. The Ajanta caves are covered in
   murals and paintings, most of which reflect Buddhist stories. </dd>

  visiting both to compare these incredible attractions.</dd>

<dd><br>-   These 34 cave shrines are up to 1,500 years old, and they are from three distinct religions:
   Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism </dd>
