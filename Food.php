<!--   Litti Chokha -->
<dl><dt></dt>

        <dd><br>- The cuisines in India are as diverse as its multi-ethnic culture. 
    The exotic and the delicious dishes of India are marked by the subtle
     uses of spices and herbs.</dd>
<dd><br>-  Every region has their own claim to fame dishes
  and different styles of cooking. The method of cooking, the flavor and 
  their specialties change with the landscapes.</dd>

  <dd><br><h3><b> Litti Chokha </b></h3></dd>
  <dd>- It is a common and much loved dish of Bihar, served for breakfast or as a tea time snack and sometimes 
    even for lunch with dal.</dd>

     </dd>
  <dd>- Litti is often stuffed with seasoned fried gram flour powder and baked on coal 
    or in an oven, and Chokha is mashed vegetable, usually prepared with potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant. </dd>
     
       <dd><br>- Litti is the stuffed whole wheat dough ball and Chokha is a mashed relish that is served with litti. 
        Chokha can be made with roasted eggplant (baingan), boiled or roasted potatoes (aloo) and roasted 
        tomatoes (tamatar).</dd>
      <dd><br>-  You can make them separately or even combine all three and make one chokha. You
        can even combine the baingan and tomatoes and make one chokha and make a second one with potatoes. </dd>
        <dd><br>- Litti with the accompanying chokha is a healthy food. litti chokha is also one of the popular street food 
          in bihar and eastern UP. During my travels to eastern UP, I did see litti chokha stalls on the roads.</dd>
          <dd><br>- Method of preparing litti is similar to dal baati of Rajasthan, but taste wise both are miles apart. Both taste different.
            Preparing litti chokha is easy but takes a lot of time. So make them at your own pace and time. For the stuffing 
            you will need sattu.</dd>
